"The Miami Showband"
The Miami Showband were one of the most successful and popular showbands in Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s.
Led at first by singer Dickie Rock, and later by Fran O'Toole, they had seven number one records on the Irish singles chart.
In 1975 during The Troubles, when returning from a performance in County Down, Northern Ireland, three members of the band, Fran O'Toole, Tony Geraghty, and Brian McCoy, were killed in what became known as the "Miami Showband massacre".

"Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine killings"
The Tandragee killings took place in the early hours of Saturday 19 February 2000 on an isolated country road outside Tandragee, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.
Two young Protestant men, Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine, were beaten and repeatedly stabbed to death in what was part of a Loyalist feud between the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and their rivals, the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).
The men were not members of any loyalist paramilitary organisation.
It later emerged in court hearings that Robb had made disparaging remarks about the killing of UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Richard Jameson by an LVF gunman the previous month.
This had angered the killers, themselves members of the Mid-Ulster UVF, and in retaliation they had lured the two men to the remote lane on the outskirts of town, where they killed and mutilated them.

"Loyalist Volunteer Force"
The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) is a small Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland.
It was formed by Billy Wright in 1996 when he and his unit split from the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) after breaking its ceasefire.
They had belonged to the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade and Wright had been the brigade's commander.
In a two-year period from August 1996, the LVF waged a paramilitary campaign with the stated goal of combatting Irish republicanism.
During this time it killed at least 14 people in gun and bomb attacks.
Almost all of its victims were Catholic civilians who were killed at random.
The LVF called off its campaign in August 1998 and decommissioned some of its weapons, but in the early 2000s a loyalist feud led to a number of killings.
Since then, the LVF has been largely inactive, but its members are believed to have been involved in rioting and organized crime.
In 2015, the security forces stated that the LVF "exists only as a criminal group" in Mid-Ulster and Antrim.

"UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade"
UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade formed part of the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force in Northern Ireland.
The brigade was established in Lurgan, County Armagh in 1972 by its first commander Billy Hanna.
The unit operated mainly around the Lurgan and Portadown areas.
Subsequent leaders of the brigade were Robin Jackson, known as "The Jackal", and Billy Wright.
The Mid-Ulster Brigade carried out many attacks, mainly in Northern Ireland, especially in the South Armagh area, but it also extended its operational reach into the Republic of Ireland.
Two of the most notorious attacks in the history of the Troubles were carried out by the Mid-Ulster Brigade: the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Miami Showband killings in 1975.
Members of the Mid-Ulster Brigade were part of the Glenanne gang which the Pat Finucane Centre has since linked to at least 87 lethal attacks in the 1970s.

"Harris Boyle"
Harris Boyle (1953 – 31 July 1975) was an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier and a high-ranking member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary organisation.
Boyle was implicated in the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and took part in the attack at Buskhill, County Down when an armed UVF gang wearing British Army uniforms ambushed The Miami Showband at a bogus military checkpoint.
The popular Irish cabaret band was driving home to Dublin after a performance in Banbridge.
He was one of the two gunmen killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus exploded prematurely.
He is sometimes referred to as Horace Boyle.

"John Francis Green"
John Francis Green (18 December 1946 – 10 January 1975), was a leading member of the North Armagh Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, holding the rank of Staff Captain and Intelligence Officer.
He was killed in a farmhouse outside Castleblayney, County Monaghan, by members of the Mid-Ulster Brigade of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).
According to Secret Intelligence Service operative Captain Fred Holroyd, British Army Captain Robert Nairac was involved in Green's killing.
Green's was one of the 87 killings attributed by the Pat Finucane Centre to the group of loyalist extremists known as the Glenanne gang.
No one was ever prosecuted for the killing.

"Miami Showband killings"
The Miami Showband killings (also called the Miami Showband Massacre) was an attack by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a loyalist paramilitary group, on 31 July 1975.
It took place on the A1 road at Buskhill in County Down, Northern Ireland.
Five people were killed, including three members of The Miami Showband, who were then one of Ireland's most popular cabaret bands.

"1991 Cappagh killings"
The 1991 Cappagh killings was a gun attack by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) on 3 March 1991 in the village of Cappagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.
A unit of the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade drove to the staunchly republican village and shot dead three Provisional IRA volunteers and a Catholic civilian at Boyle's Bar.

"Wesley Somerville"
William Wesley Somerville (c. 1941 – 31 July 1975) was a Northern Irish loyalist, who held the rank of lieutenant in the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force's (UVF) Mid-Ulster Brigade during the period of conflict known as "the Troubles".
He also served as a member of the British state's legal Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).
Somerville was part of the UVF unit that ambushed the Irish cabaret band The Miami Showband at Buskhill, County Down, which resulted in the deaths of three of the bandmembers.
Somerville was killed, along with Harris Boyle, when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus exploded prematurely.
His brother, John James Somerville (a former UDR soldier) was one of the three men convicted of the murders of bandmembers Brian McCoy, Fran O'Toole and Tony Geraghty.

"Richard Jameson (loyalist)"
Richard Jameson (c. 1953 – 10 January 2000), was a Northern Irish businessman and loyalist, who served as the leader of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force's (UVF) Mid-Ulster Brigade.
He was killed outside his Portadown home during a feud with the rival Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), the breakaway organisation founded by former Mid-Ulster UVF commander Billy Wright after he and the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade were officially stood down by the Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) in August 1996.
